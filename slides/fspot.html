	<li>Finally, you can select some photos and use the Export option to write them to CDs, email them to friends or share them online with services like Picasa and Flickr.</li>
	<li>To get started, open F-Spot from the Graphics Applications menu or attach a digital camera and follow the prompt that appears.</li>
