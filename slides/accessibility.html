<h1 class="title">Accessibility in Ubuntu</h1>

<div class="main">

<div class="content"><ul>
	<li>One of our goals is to make computing easy whatever peoples' circumstances. So, we provide a range of tools that make Ubuntu one of the most accessible operating systems around.</li>  
	<li>You can get at these tools in one place: <em>Assistive Technologies Preferences.</em> From there, you can set up wrist-friendly mouse and keyboard behaviours like slow keys and dwell click. The <em>Preferred Applications</em> section lets you enable a screen reader called Orca or choose between others that are installed.</li>
	<li>There are some handy options in <em>Appearance Preferences</em>, too. For example, to make text more readable, you can customize the fonts that are used by applications.</li>
