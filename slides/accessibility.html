<h1 class="title">Accessibility in Ubuntu</h1>

<div class="main">

<div class="content"><ul>
	<li>We want to make computers work for everyone, whatever your physical circumstances. So, we provide tools that make Ubuntu one of the most accessible operating systems around.</li>  
	<li>You can get at these tools in one place: the <em>Assistive Technologies Preferences,</em> inside the System Menu. From there, you can change the behaviour of your keyboard or mouse and you can enable the Orca screen reader.</li>
	<li>Remember to check out the <em>Appearance Preferences</em>, too. You can choose between different visual styles and even change the fonts that are used by applications.</li>
</ul></div>
