	<li>One of our goals is to make computing easy whatever peoples' circumstances. So, we provide a range of tools that make Ubuntu one of the most accessible operating systems around.</li>  
	<li>You can get at these tools in one place: the <em>Assistive Technologies Preferences.</em></li>
	<li>There are some handy options in <em>Appearance Preferences</em>, too. For example, you can change the fonts that are used by applications.</li>
