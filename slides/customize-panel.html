	<p>Want to have more workspaces to organize windows? How about a stock ticker that's always visible in a corner of the screen, or a search box that is always there with a flick of the mouse?<!-- Uhm... do we get Deskbar by default? --> ...Maybe a fortune-telling goldfish?</p>
	<p>You can have that and more! Try right clicking on any empty space in a panel and choose "Add to Panel." The choices that appear, called Applets, will be visible from the moment you first log in. Add as many as you would like. The applets themselves can be customized even more. For example, to change the format of the clock or to move it around, just click it with the right mouse button to get a menu.</p>
