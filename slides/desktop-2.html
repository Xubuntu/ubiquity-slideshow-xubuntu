	<p>On the panel to the bottom of the screen there is a list of windows that are open.<!-- To explain windows or not to?... --> You can click on a window in the list to bring it to the front. If it's important that you see a window it will start to glow.</p>
	<p>There is a handy detail on the right side, called the workspace switcher. Ubuntu lets you move windows to their own workspaces so there are no distractions around them. Just drag a window from the window list into the workspace switcher to move it, or right click on a window's title bar to get at some interesting options!</p>
