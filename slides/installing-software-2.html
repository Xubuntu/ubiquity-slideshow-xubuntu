	<p>While we try to include a lot of popular software in the Ubuntu repositories, there is no way we could keep up-to-date with the thousands of new pieces of software being created every day.</p>
	<p>That is why it is easy to install third-party software that is not included in the official Ubuntu repositories (though you should make sure that it is from a reputable source!). When it is necessary, look for Ubuntu packages to install. These can be managed with the more advanced package management tool called Synaptic Package Manager.</p>
