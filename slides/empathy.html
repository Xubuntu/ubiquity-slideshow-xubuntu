	<li>With <em>Empathy IM</em>, Ubuntu can keep you connected right from the start. It works with all the major instant messaging networks, including Google Talk, Windows Live and Jabber.</li>
	<li>You can change your status at any time by clicking your name at the top right of the screen.</li>
	<li>Empathy hides in the Message Indicator, which looks like an envelope beside the clock. Any new messages get placed there, too, so you can respond to them when you want.</li>
</ul></div>
