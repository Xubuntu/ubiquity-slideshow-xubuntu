		<p>Hi, Peter. What's happening? We need to talk about your TPS reports. ...Yeah. Did you get that memo? ...Ah! Yeah. It's just we're putting new coversheets on all the TPS reports before they go out now. So if you could go ahead and try to remember to do that from now on, that'd be great. All right!</p>
		<p>So, Peter, what's happening?<br />Aahh, now, are you going to go ahead and open up
		<span class="menu-item">Office <img class="menu-arrow" />OpenOffice.org Word Processor</span> and have those TPS reports for us this afternoon? ...Oh, and remember: next Friday... is Hawaiian shirt day. So, you know, if you want to, go ahead and wear a Hawaiian shirt and jeans.</p>
