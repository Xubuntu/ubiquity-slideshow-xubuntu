	<p>Ubuntu is organized into a "desktop." We try to keep it very neat and tidy for you so all the important pieces of information are available right away.</p>
	<p>When you first log in, you will see two panels at the top and bottom of the screen. To the top left is the Main Menu where you can start applications, access storage devices attached to your computer, or change settings. On the top right you will find the Notification Area. A message appears there, for exmaple, if someone sends you an instant message or if there is an application running in the background.<!-- And hopefully some day we'll say that safely knowing it's all gneerated by the same front-end! --> There is information about the current state of your computer, for example remaining battery life, wireless connections or volume.</p>
