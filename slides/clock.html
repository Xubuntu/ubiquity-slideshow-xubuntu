	<p>The clock in Ubuntu does more than tell the time.</p>
	<p>It integrates seamlessly with Evolution Calendar to remind you of upcoming events or important tasks so you never miss an important meeting again.</p>
	<p>For communicating across time zones, unfold the Locations section to find out exactly what time it is and even what the weather is like anywhere around the globe.</p>
