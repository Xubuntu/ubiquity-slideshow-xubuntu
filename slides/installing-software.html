<h1 class="title">Installing additional software</h1>

<div class="main">

<div class="content"><ul>
	<li>Take a look at the <em>Software Center</em> to install (and uninstall) software from our online repository, which we carefully organize to be safe and up to date.</li>
	<li>There is great software for everything from creating music and movies to producing 3D models and exploring the universe.</li>
	<li>If you need something that isn't available through us, find out if there is a Debian package or another repository available. That way, it will be really easy to install and you will receive automatic updates.</li>
</ul></div>
