<div class="main">

<div class="content"><ul>
	<li>Take a look at the <em>Software Center</em> to install (and uninstall) software from our online repository, which we carefully organize to be safe and up to date.</li>
	<li>There is great software for everything from making music and movies to creating 3D models and exploring the galaxy.</li>
	<li>Software Center can also keep track of software from other places. Just check if they provide a repository designed for Ubuntu, or a Debian package, and install that.</li>
