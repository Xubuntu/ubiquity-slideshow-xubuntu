	<li>Use the <emph>Software Store</emph> to install (and uninstall) software from our online repository, which we carefully organize to be safe and up to date.</li>
	<li>There are many great applications available, for everything from recording music and making panoramas to 3D animation and building robots.</li>
	<li>Software Store also keeps track of packages from other places, as long as they were added the standard way. Just check if they provide a Debian package or a repository designed for Ubuntu.</li>
