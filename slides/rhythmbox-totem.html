<h1 class="title">Music and movies in Ubuntu</h1>

<div class="main">

<div class="content"><ul>
	<li>Ubuntu is ready to play videos and music from the web and from DVDs. It works straight away for free and popular formats; the ones we can always use without paying license fees. In other cases, Ubuntu will ask for permission and then download the right software from the Internet.</li>
	<li><em>Rhythmbox Music Player</em> lets you organize your music and listen to Internet radio. It also keeps track of podcasts, to download new episodes of a show automatically.</li>
	<li>Just plug in an MP3 player to start synchronizing your music collection, or insert a CD to copy its music to your computer.</li>
</ul></div>
