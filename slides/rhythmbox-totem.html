<div class="main">

<div class="content"><ul>
	<li>Ubuntu is ready to play videos and music from the web and from DVDs. It works straight away for free and popular formats; the ones people can use without paying license fees. When you play media in other formats, Ubuntu will ask for permission and then download the right software from the Internet.</li>
	<li>Rhythmbox Music Player helps organize your music in one place, listen to Internet radio or download Creative Commons music. It also keeps track of Podcasts, so it can automatically download new episodes to listen on the go.</li>
	<li>Just plug in an MP3 player to start synchronizing your music collection, or insert a CD to copy its music to your computer.</li>
</ul></div>
