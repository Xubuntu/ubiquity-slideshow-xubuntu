FIXMEs:

* "However it goes, let us know at www.ubuntu.com/community!"
That line almost sounds like we are expecting things to go wrong. We need a genius to word this without sounding like my Wacom Bamboo packaging and without planting the possibility that things could go poorly.

* Screenshots are ugly. Text has come out fuzzy, text size and theme is wrong, events and times do not line up between images at all. This needs more care and attention.

* Description of world clock (Locations) portion does not accommodate extra-terrestrials by saying that it tells the time /anywhere/. Two possible fixes: Display Mars time (which would be awesome) via a totally over-engineered plugin interface, or come up with a way of saying "anywhere on Earth" that isn't horribly geeky.

* It is also not yet accurate in saying that time and weather info is available for "everywhere", since we are limited to particular cities. Hopefully that will be resolved for Jackalope.

* Writing throughout needs help. It does not connect with what an everyday user wants, sounding more like a feature for businesses and meetings. Let's make this sound cool.


slides/installing-software*.svg

* The title "How to get more software" is ugly.

* Both of these need screenshots! Screenshots of the various applications as well as a default Ubuntu menu open to the appropriate sections. Maybe an artsy graphic with a huge pile of icons or something somewhere...

* We should make a note that third party software should be treated carefully, but do so without generating paranoia and without sounding like worry-warts ourselves.

* Too much writing? Let's see how the screenshots change the landscape.

* Mention third party software repositories and the Software Sources configuration.
