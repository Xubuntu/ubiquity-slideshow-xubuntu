<p>New in 10.04. Ubuntu's music player includes an integrated store, so you can buy and download new tracks with just a few clicks. And thanks to Ubuntu One's file-syncing magic you can store your music online and listen to it from other computers and music players. Ubuntu works with most music and media players.</p>
