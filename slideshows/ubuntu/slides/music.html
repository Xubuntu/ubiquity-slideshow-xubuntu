<p>Ubuntu's music player includes a built-in store, so you can buy and download new tracks with a few clicks. And thanks to Ubuntu One's file-syncing magic you can store your music online and listen to it from other computers. You can add your music to a portable music player, too; just plug one in to get started.</p>
