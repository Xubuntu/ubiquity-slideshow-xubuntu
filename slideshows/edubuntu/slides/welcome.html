<p style="text-align: justify;">Welcome to what will eventually become Edubuntu 13.04.
This release is in an alpha state and you can expect to find some rather large problems
or unfinished parts. Use only for testing purposes and entirely at your own risk.
Back up all data before trying it out and do not use in production.</p>

<br /> <br /> <br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Thank you for testing, we appreciate your feedback!</b></p>
