<div class="main">

<div class="content"><ul>
	<li><em>Abiword</em> is a word processor, which can read almost all known document formats. You will have access to any fonts installed in your system and editing documents is a breeze.</li>
	<li><em>Gnumeric</em> is a spreadsheet program with an emphasis on accuracy. It can also be used to merge mathematical data into Abiword documents.</li>
	<li>While Abiword and Gnumeric are considered lightweight, they provide almost all of the functions of the OpenOffice suite.</li>
</ul>
<p class="special">For power users, the OpenOffice.org suite is available in just a few clicks  â€“ just install it from the Ubuntu Software Center.</p></div>
