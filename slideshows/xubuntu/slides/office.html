		<p><em>Abiword</em> is a word processor, which can read almost all known document formats. You will have access to any fonts installed in your system and editing documents is a breeze.</p>
		<p><em>Gnumeric</em> is a spreadsheet program with an emphasis on accuracy. It can also be used to merge mathematical data into Abiword documents.</p>
		<p>While Abiword and Gnumeric are considered lightweight, they provide almost all of the functions of the LibreOffice suite.</p>
