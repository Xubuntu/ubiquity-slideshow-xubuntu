	<li><em>GIMP</em> (listed under Applications &rarr; Graphics) is an image editor that allows as much or as little manipulation of the images as you choose. It can be used to construct images or modify photos and images.</li>
	<li>For your listening pleasure, give <em>Exaile Music Player</em> a spin. It is capable of playing all your music, from mp3 to cd to live radio on the internet.</li>
	<li>If you need to burn a CD or DVD, check out <em>Brasero</em>. It is very easy to use, and will even burn the Xubuntu image for you.</li>
</ul>
<p class="special">All of these applications are available in the live CD, even while installing. Go adventurous!</p></div>
