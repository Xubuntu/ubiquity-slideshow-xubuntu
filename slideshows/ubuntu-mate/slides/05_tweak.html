      <p>The default Ubuntu MATE user interface is intuitive and easy
      to use. But we understand people have different tastes and
      preferences, which is why we created <strong>MATE Tweak</strong>;
      a tool to change the user interface to mimic other operating
      systems. Coming from Windows? Try <strong>Redmond</strong>.
      Prefer the way macOS is layed out? Try <strong>Cupertino</strong>.
      For Ubuntu Unity fans take a look at <strong>Mutiny</strong>.
      Or for a hybrid user interface, try <strong>Pantheon</strong>
      or <strong>Comptemporary</strong>. Experienced users can
      customise the user interface and save their creations.</p>
