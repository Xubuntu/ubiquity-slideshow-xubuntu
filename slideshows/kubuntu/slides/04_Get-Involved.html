        The Kubuntu community consists of a group of individuals who
        made up one of the greatest teams in the open source community,
        who work on various aspects of the distribution, provide advice and
        technical support, and help to promote Kubuntu to a wider audience.

        No matter your skill level, getting involved and helping to
        mold the future of Kubuntu is easy, and you are more than welcome
        to help out. Remember, it is easy to get involved and the work you
        do will be seen by millions of people around the world.
