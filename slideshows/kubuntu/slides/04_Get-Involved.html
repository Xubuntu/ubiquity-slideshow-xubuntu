        The Kubuntu community consists of a group of individuals who
        made up one of the greatest teams in the open source community,
        working on various aspects of the distribution, providing advice and
        technical support, as well as helping to promote Kubuntu to a wider
        audience.

       No matter your skill level, getting involved and helping to mold 
       the future of Kubuntu is easy, and you are more than welcome to help out.
