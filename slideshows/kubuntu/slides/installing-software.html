	<ul>
	    <li>Take a look at <em>Software Management</em> application in the
	    menu under the System tab. Software Management will allow you to
	    install (and remove) software from our online repositories, which
	    we carefully organize to be safe and up to date.</li>
	    <li>There is great software for everything from creating music and
	    movies to producing 3D models and exploring the universe.</li>
	    <li>If you need something that isn't available through us, find out
	    if there is a Debian package or another repository available. That
	    way, it will be really easy to install and you will receive
	    automatic updates.</li>
