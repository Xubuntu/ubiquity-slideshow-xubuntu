	    <li>We want to make computers work for everyone, whatever your
	    physical circumstances. So, we provide tools that make Kubuntu one
	    of the most accessible operating systems around.</li>
	    <li>You can get at these tools in one place: the
	    <em>Accessibility</em> preferences, inside the Desktop Behavior from the System Settings application from the menu. From there, you can turn on helpful
	    tools like <em>Modifier Keys</em>, <em>Keyboard Filters</em>, and
	    <em>Activation Gestures</em>.</li>
	    <li>Remember to also look over the <em>Application Style</em>.</li>
