* alt text for images in slides

* .desktop file for slideshow. Add to debian/install. We want this to
be placed with example-content. Should run default web browser with a
slideshow tuned to the case where the user is NOT presently installing
Ubuntu, but is still (of course) a new Ubuntu user.


FIXMEs:

slides/fspot.html
	* Screenshots need to be touched up. Currently have redundant
	Find bar, and something has been scaled oddly. Current screenshot
	of Tags list does not have correct icon theme applied (note
	Events tag).

slides/screenshots/translations-gdm.png
	* Keep an eye on what happens to GDM for Karmic and make sure
	this image stays up to date. (Extra emphasis because it will
	probably change and because it's an important visual cue!)

slides/screenshots/installing-software-updates.png
	* Out of date. The "software updates are available" notification
	bubble does not actually happen. This could be a nice picture
	of the update window, instead.



Slides still awaiting screenshots:
	* welcome.html (will do nearer the release)
