* .desktop file for slideshow. Add to debian/install. We want this to
be placed with example-content. Should run default web browser with a
slideshow tuned to the case where the user is NOT presently installing
Ubuntu, but is still (of course) a new Ubuntu user.

* Translation infrastructure: Need Javascript solution in
slides/index.html that will automatically load the appropriate localized
version of each slide.

* Make a smarter Makefile, with targets and the like to avoid rebuilding
the entire thing every time make gets run.
