Ubuntu Slideshow Data

Slideshow to display with the Ubiquity GTK front-end for Ubuntu

-----

Quick design guidelines for slides:

We have a size limit! This should fit on a screen resolution below 800x600 along with the Ubiquity progress bar and information. Thus, slides should be designed to the size of 700x420 pixels. It will look very ugly if the slideshow keeps changing size, so let's try sticking to the same dimensions here.

Please use slide_template.svg as a base for your slides; this way, we will be able to maintain a standard format.

More to come. For now, this project is in early days, so there is no real art direction. Feel free to take liberties with your design and ideas; let's see what can be done here!
