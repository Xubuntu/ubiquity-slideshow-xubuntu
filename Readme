Slideshow to display with the Ubiquity GTK front-end for Ubuntu
<http://launchpad.net/ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntu>

-----

This project contains a slideshow focused on Ubuntu Linux. It is to be presented while installing Ubuntu using Ubiquity. This is associated with the ubiquity-slideshow group on Launchpad at <https://launchpad.net/~ubiquity-slideshow>, which also owns a branch of Ubiquity that handles displaying the slideshow.

Feedback on the project, this Readme, or anything at all is appreciated!

Please also note the "Licenses", "ToDo" and "Contributors" files in this directory, which all have cool stuff.

Writing guidelines:

* Write in the present (no "Ubuntu will" or "Ubuntu would"). Not just present tense, but with an awareness of what is going on around the slideshow. We can assume the user is running a default Ubuntu session as he installs it, and also that he has chosen to install Ubuntu willingly; that person is now an Ubuntu user. The sales-person voice should not exist. If you start to hear that voice, file a bug immediately.

* Avoid the car instruction manual voice where possible. That is, try not to tell people where specific features are, but what they can expect to find. This is because the slideshow won't follow our users everywhere, so we have to answer a different question: "What next?" If we fixate energy on pressing buttons, it will not stick :)

* Write from the perspective of us (people, probably) explaining Ubuntu and free software to the immediate end user; the person behind the screen. Think of it as enthusing with a friend about this great new thing they have started to explore, making sure they know what they need to know to really enjoy it.

Design guidelines:

Thanks to Andrew Higginson for the wonderful new slide design which actually looks good! With that contribution, I'm going to drop the "I have no idea where this is going" line and say: "Make more of those slides!"
Some quick things to keep in mind...

* Refrain from using drop shadows or reflections inside the white content area of a slide.

* Please avoid showing the background image in a screenshot without good reason since it will conflict with the surrounding styling. Please do not scale screenshots; just crop them smartly. Minor image manipulation (eg: moving unnecessarily large gaps closer together) is allowed.

-----

DO BE AFRAID to split a single thing across multiple slides. Please try to keep things neat, tidy and short. In a lot of caces we can trust our viewers to find things on their own as long as we show them where to start, so it's possible for a single slide to do quite a bit.

Quick technical information for slides:

* We have a size limit! The slideshow should fit on a screen resolution below 800x600 along with the Ubiquity progress bar and information. Thus, slides should be designed to the size of 700x420 pixels.

* Please use slides/Template.html to start off new slides. This way, we will be able to maintain a standard format. Of course, if you feel that a different template would work better, let us know.

* The slideshow is created using HTML, Javascript and CSS. There is a file called Slideshow.html which rotates between slides and embeds them in itself, (in the process creating a simple transition effect). The slides are very simple, small snippets of HTML. When loaded by Slideshow.html, slides gain the properties of the CSS stylesheet in slides/link/general.css. Note that these are SNIPPETS; they do not contain headers, body tags, or anything of that sort and when viewed appear very plain or may not render in a web browser at all.
Slides should contain some divisions with the following IDs in this order: "title", "main", "content", and "screenshots". There should also be a small image with the id "icon". The "content" and "screenshots" divisions should be children on the "main" division. The "screenshots" division should contain some images (preferably 3), which are explained on the Ubiquity/Slideshow wiki page <https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Ubiquity/Slideshow>. The "content" section should contain a short written explanation of the slide. In theory, you could actually put whatever you please inside the "main" division, but "screenshots" and "content" are highly recommended.

* The icon I mention is at the top right of each slide. It is a small image, typically representing the application or action being described by the slide. This should be the same icon the user normally sees associated with that application. These icons are 64x64 pixel PNGs stored in the slides/icons directory.

* To view your slide (or the slideshow) in its full glory, you will need to edit slides/Slideshow.html. Add your slide to the list inside its "container" section, then open that file in a web browser.
