    https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LucidLynx/ReleaseManifest.  The release is
    10.04 LTS, not 10.04.

    better on netbook (1024x600) screens.

  * Title aligns by bottom of new .header container (which was added to
    HTML for each slide). Second line uses smaller text than first line.
    This means titles can exceed a single line and still look nice.
  * Updated slides to use .content .wrap-top class when icon exceeds the
    usual container.   Moved / enlarged content block to fit another
    line of text without scrolling.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]

  * Larger dimensions for Ubuntu slideshow: 816x500, from 700x420.
  * Removed GIMP build dependency. GIMP scripts in images-source no

    manually in source package.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]

  * Rearranged source package to closely mirror build output.
  * Renamed ./slides to ./slideshows, reflecting new arrangement.

    slideshow virtual package, to ensure that only one slideshow can be
    installed at a time and so we can put all of the files in a single
    location (LP: #526483).  The upgrade slideshows do the same with the
    ubiquity-slideshow-upgrade virtual package.
  * Update update-launchpad-translations.sh to reflect recent directory
    layout changes.
  * Update translations from Launchpad.
  * Remove possibly inappropriate URL from br translation (LP: #528465).

  * Adding support for right-to-left languages (LP: #446989).
  * When #rtl is appended to URL, index.html will load the rtl.css
    stylesheet via Javascript.

    responsible for little hacks to get right-to-left languages
    looking right.

  * Updated translation templates. The template for installing-software.html
    is entirely changed and should be translated again at some point. (Sorry,
    translators!) welcome.html and documentation.html are not quite as major,
    but if they were translated word-for-word they could probably use a
    do-over.
  * Merging my recent changes, including revised welcome and farewell slides.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Freeze exception (LP: #436063).

    (LP: #421864).
  * Updated translations from Launchpad.

    (LP: #427257, #427254).
  * Makefile now checks if po2html is installed and exits (slightly more)
    gracefully, albeit with rather horrendous looking output :)
  * Added --progress=names when calling po2html. Makefile output is now a bit
    tidier.
