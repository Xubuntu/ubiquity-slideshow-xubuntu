    slides.

ubiquity-slideshow-ubuntu (7) karmic; urgency=low

  [ Dylan McCall ]
  * Updated translation templates. The template for installing-software.html
    is entirely changed and should be translated again at some point. (Sorry,
    translators!) welcome.html and documentation.html are not quite as major,
    but if they were translated word-for-word they could probably use a
    do-over.
  * Merging my recent changes, including revised welcome and farewell slides.

  [ Evan Dandrea ]
  * Freeze exception (LP: #436063).
  * Update translations from Launchpad.

    dependency on python-utidylib (LP: #430719).

    (LP: #421864).
  * Updated translations from Launchpad.

  [ Dylan McCall ]
  * Fixed comma splice in documentation.html
  * Corrected missing "with" in the third bullet point. Fixed title
    (LP: #427257, #427254).
  * Makefile now checks if po2html is installed and exits (slightly more)
    gracefully, albeit with rather horrendous looking output :)
  * Added --progress=names when calling po2html. Makefile output is now a bit
    tidier.
